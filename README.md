# docker-challenge-template

Introduction
In this project, we were tasked with completing two Docker challenges to learn more about containerization and its relationship with Operating Systems and Cloud Computing courses. The two challenges involved building a simple web server using Nginx and creating a Node.js application.

Challenge 1: Serving Static Pages with Nginx
The first challenge was to create a simple web server using Nginx to serve static pages. Here are the steps we took to complete the challenge:
1.	Created a new folder called challenge1
2.	Created a public folder and added an index.htmal file with our name and student ID
3.	Created a Dockerfile that installed Nginx and copied the public folder to the container
4.	Built the Docker image using the Dockerfile
5.	Ran the Docker container with the correct parameters to serve the pages at http://localhost:8080/

Throughout this challenge, we learned about the basics of Docker and Nginx, including how to create a Dockerfile, build a Docker image, and run a Docker container. We also learned how to use the Dockerfile to install Nginx and serve static pages.

Challenge 2: Creating a Simple Node.js Application
The second challenge was to create a simple Node.js application that could be containerized using Docker. Here are the steps we took to complete the challenge:
1.	Created a new Node.js application
2.	Created a Dockerfile that installed Node.js and copied the application code to the container
3.	Created a docker-compose.yml file to orchestrate the webserver and Node.js application

Throughout this challenge, we learned about creating a Node.js application, containerizing it using Docker, and orchestrating it using docker-compose. We also learned about the importance of using version control and collaboration tools like GitHub to manage our code.

Findings and Learning Experience
Throughout this project, we learned a lot about containerization, Docker, and how they relate to Operating Systems and Cloud Computing courses. We gained hands-on experience creating Docker images, running Docker containers, and orchestrating web servers and Node.js applications.

We also learned about the importance of using version control and collaboration tools like GitHub to manage our code. This allowed us to easily share our code with others, track changes, and collaborate on projects.

Overall, this project was a valuable learning experience and helped us to better understand the concepts of containerization and how they can be applied in real-world scenarios.
